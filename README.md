# <p align="center"> Image Denoising</p>

This repository implements an image denoising pipeline using the [U<sup>2</sup>-Net architecture](https://github.com/xuebinqin/U-2-Net), originally developed for salient object detection. Here, we adapt it for denoising high-resolution images from the [DIV2K dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soumikrakshit/div2k-high-resolution-images) with synthetic Gaussian noise.
